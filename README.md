# Credit-card-fraud-detection
•	It is a classification problem with class imbalance because the percentage of fraud transactions is typically low
•	Handled class imbalance through techniques like oversampling, SMOTE etc., 
•	Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost etc.,
•	Implemented Bayesian grid search for hyper parameters tuning by optimizing for Recall as the cost of false negative is too high compared to a false positive
